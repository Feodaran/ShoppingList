# ShoppingList
This is an attempt to make a shopping list. I've only just started it. The idea was to get and display price of an item (cost x quantity) then at the end, display overall cost, while allowing the user to just have a generic shopping list.<br/><br/>

I think I should use a spreadsheet or something with cells. Have entries in a row. Then use a database to store the data if users want to save the shopping list. <br/><br/>

The way the programme is at the moment (10th of June 2018) there is no object for overall cost, the contents of the textboxes are just dumped in the txtShoppingList textbox, and no calculations are being done. There is also no validation for the price and quantity textboxes. Also the shopping list textbox should be disabled so users can't type in it. And for some reason I put a Â£ next to the quantity textbox.
